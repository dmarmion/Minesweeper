To play, run **`python minesweeper.py`**

At each turn, you can either:

- Uncover a cell (`uncover <column> <row>`)
- Flag a cell (`flag <column> <row>`)

If your terminal has issues displaying coloured text, you can run the program with the `-w` argument, which will avoid changing colours when printing flags.
